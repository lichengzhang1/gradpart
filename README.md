# Gradpart
This is Gradpart's second storage. Its official address is http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/thomas_g/gradpart.html.
Gradpart is a C++ program. It works with a combination of homomorphism-principle and orderly generation. It computes all isomorphism-types of graphs with a given degree-sequence by recursively splitting the vertices of maximal degree ( until regular graphs are reached ), and gluing the pieces together to the whole graphs. If you want to know a bit more about the mathematical theory, then click here. There exists a graphical user-interface for Linux,SGI and Dec-Alpha written with Motif. 

**It is worth noting that this program is about 35 years old and cannot be compiled by the current gcc compiler. Look forward to future changes.**
